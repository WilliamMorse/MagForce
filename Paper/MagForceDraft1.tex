\begin{abstract} 
In this experiment we set out to give the TeachSpin magnetic force apparatus its inaugural run. First we calibrated a hall effect probe and measured the on axis field of a Helmholtz coil pair in both Helmholtz and quadrupole configurations. We used these results to verify theory for the magnetic field gradient of one coil and for the constant gradient in the center of two coils in the quadrupole configuration. Next, with a calibrated spring we measure the force on a small neodymium magnet in the quadrupole field. Combining this measurement with the gradent model, we were able to find the dipole moment of the magnet.

% By manipulating the direction of current within each coil we can change the shape of the magnetic field inside the Helmholtz configuration. We begin by for computing the on axis magnetic field B inside our Helmholtz configuration,

\caption{Helmholtz coils are named in honor of the German scientist Herman von Helmholtz, who, among others researched electromagnetism. Helmholtz coils are made from two identical coils with radius R. The centers of both coils are placed on the same axis distance R away from one another. In this apparatus the coils are spaced slightly more than one radius apart to compensate for the physical size of the wire and maintain a uniform field in the center.}

%There are several ways to measure magnetic fields. since the invention of SQIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) \ref art of electronics drinking glass page there are no methods more sensitive. however squids have a high entry cost and to maintain a liquid nitrogen setup to cool the apparatus is somewhat complicated. Hall-effect sensors can measure fields with 10\% accuracy and are extremely cheap. we wanted to explore the sensitivity, noise performance, linearity and gain of a TeachSpin analog output hall sensor. the sensor claimed a gain of 1 volt per Milli-Tesla. 

\section{Hall Probe Calibration}

To calibrate our probe we wound a 575 turn solenoid. Our calibration rides on the error in the current supplied to the solenoid, the length of the solenoid as well as the field model of the solenoid: 
$$\vec B = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{L}$$ 
With the probe inserted roughly two fifths of the way into the solenoid, we took several measurements with a constant current supply. Plotting the theoretical field as a function of the sensor's output voltage gives us the gain of the sensor from a fit line. The output is linear in the range we intend to utilize in our next experiments with an rsq of $0.9999973$.  and we were able to measure the uncertainty in the calibration as: this combined with the uncertainty in our voltmeter will let us measure magnetic fields at: $\pm 0.5 \mu T$.




\section{Mapping the Helmholtz Field}
With our calibrated hall probe we measured the b field at different points along the symmetry  axis of the TeachSpin Helmholtz coil pair. We modeled the theoretical field by deriving the on axis field of one current loop and then taking a sum of the field for each wire in the apparatus.  Derived from the Biot-Savart law, the field for one loop of wire is:
$$\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_0}{2}\frac{I R_z^2}{\sqrt{R_y^2 + R_z^2}^3}$$
Where $R_z$ the radius of the loop and $R_y$ is the distance along the axis of symmetry away from the plane of the loop. \cite{knight}

\caption{Helmholtz configuration. The first field model used only two current loops (one for each coil). The second model splits the current over each loop of wire in the apparatus which respects the volume of each winding. The correction in the second model does little to encompass the error bars in our data.}

We also used the Helmholtz coils in quadrupole configuration. The only difference in the field model is that we reverse the field influence of the second coil. The  With the quadrupole configuration, we can get a very uniform gradient field in the center of the coil pair, which allows us to verify that the force on a magnetic dipole is proportional to the gradient in the field. 



%Additionally, this gradent gets weaker on boundaries of the uniform poriton. If the frorce on a dipole is proportional to the gradent in the field, the center of the quadrupole field will be a stable equilibrium point.
